    <h1><a id="being">I. On Being a Man</a></h1>
    <p class="exception">“And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort and advancing on Chaos and the Dark”<br><br>- Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance, paragraph 3</p>
    <p>1. In just about any culture, in just about any age, with the exception of the current one, a boy in his mid to late teens would undergo some sort of rite of passage or initiation, going in a boy and coming out a Man. He would be expected to carry himself like a man in his relationships with the world. In turn, he could expect from the world the due respect and privileges that are obvious part of his position in it. As long as this position too, is obvious.</p>
    <p>2. My question for you, reader, is, did you have a culturally, socially, emotionally and spiritually profound initiation into manhood? By your own appraisal, do you feel like you are a Man? Do you think that you live up to the title? I know that, for me, the answer to those questions is a clear “No.” And I trust my experience when it tells me that the same is true for almost all would-be men. If they are honest with themselves. But why?</p>
    <p>3. When it comes to initiations, Nature initiates women and Culture initiates men. Femininity has always been of Nature and masculinity has always been of Culture. “Women are, Men become”, as the saying goes. There are, obviously, natural, biological aspects to masculinity as well as cultural aspects to femininity but when we inquire, what is it that makes us? Ultimately, the previous truth stands. Male biology is a prerequisite, is permissive, to masculinity, but it is not masculinity itself. This explains squarely the crisis of masculinity that has colored the last four or five decades. Nature’s constancy has still given structure to femininity, even in the absence of a culture that does so. The same cannot be said for masculinity. Culture has failed men. And, to the degree that culture is the province of Man, Men have failed Men. We inherited a culture made by weak men.</p>
    <p>4. I know that I am falling short and not living up to the demands of masculinity. Nature, very clearly, tells me that much. My Soul feels as if it was rotting. But I don’t know what it is that I am falling short of, nor how to fix it. And this, Nature will not tell me; most feminine indeed. I don’t know what it means to be a Man, so how could I not fail? Why wasn’t I taught by Culture what it means to be a Man? Why do I feel like something was stolen from me?</p>
    <p>5. This and the following essays are an attempt, for my own sake, to understand and describe masculinity. To answer the question “What does it mean to be a Man?” This question glimmers with the prospect of adventure; of unthinkable potential; of reclaiming a birthright; of cherishing a long neglected heritage, answering it’s claims, making it proud and, in time, take my rightful place in it.</p>
    
    <h1><a id="gods">II. Our Soul and the Gods</a></h1>
    <p class="exception"></p>
    <p>1. For the introduction to this section there are two facts, as I see them, that I want to present. I find them fundamental to understanding the following pages and the workings of Man in general.</p>
    <p>2. The first fact is that we are populated by gods. In one character, in one Man, there are vast arrays of desires, moods, impulses, needs and aspirations. While some may be simple, like thirst, many others are much more complex and opaque to the understanding while also being, exactly like thirst, of iron necessity to life; consider Freedom. Furthermore, these needs and inspirations are not inert, flat things like an alarm or a signpost, delivering some dead information, but rather are alive, being as it were shards of Man’s personality. With their own desires, fears, means of acting, habits, memories among other functions. All men, in their healthy state, are possessed by a firmament of personalities. The polytheistic cultures from ancient times have articulated and symbolized these forces as gods or spirits that exist independently from men and largely mysterious to them who, on what to the mortals often seems like whim, possess people or influence events in a way characteristic to their nature. One confounds the native for the primitive to great peril.</p>
    <p>3. But this is not the only fact. Our soul is not simply a patchwork of divine tantrums. It is also a sense of being. A sense of Self. A sense of “I”. A sense of private sovereignty. A sense of separation from the riot of gods. A sense of separation from the physics and matter of the Cosmos. A feeling that we are not just the effect of a cause. A feeling of consciousness, reason and awareness; of Logos; of being the Soul itself, or at least a part of it. And this is the second fact. We are the Logos made flesh.</p>
    <p>4. Entire libraries can, and have, been written about these two facts. But I will not dwell on them any longer, at least not in isolation, past these handful of paragraphs. The reason to bring them up in the first place was to make them explicit. Bring them in front of you and declare them as the facts I saw them as. This two facts and their implications are the axiomatic foundations on which this essay rests. In our Soul, we dance with the gods.</p>
    <p>5. The following pages will explore only a handful of these spirits; the ones I found to be guiding stars on this investigation and which, when I looked, seemed to arrange themselves into the constellation of Man. I will consider my investigation successful if, when I see it complete, the following questions have been answered, even if indirectly and in an impressionistic way. What does it mean to have War, Freedom and Culture in our Soul? What should be our relationship to these spirits, if we are to be men? Why are we, civilized people, so deaf and blind to these gods when beasts and brutes are not?</p>
    
    <h1><a id="ideals">III. The Masculine Ideal</a></h1>
    <p class="exception">Our ideals speak of, and to, Everything.</p>
    <p>1. This entire essay, and especially this following section concerns itself greatly with ideals. My hope in this introduction is for you, the reader, to also grow concerned with ideals. There are four truths, as I see them, that are relevant to our investigation. I’ll present them ordered roughly from the simplest and most practical to the more abstract.</p>
    <p>2. Firstly, our ideals speak to us. They do so in two ways. The way that, surely, all are familiar with is as a judge. To the degree that our ideals show us possibility, of Truth, and Right, and Power and Beauty, they inevitable show us too the lack of these in reality. Just how short we fall of what could or ought to be. This is, invariably, an ever present source of crushing, oppressive pain. The weak have always attempted to escape this private indictment by refusing to face up and look at their ideals in the eye. Usually denying the existence of the ideal itself or lying to themselves about its true quality.</p>
    <p>3. But our ideals speak to us in a different, much more tender, way too. They speak to us as a guide. Sometimes willing to walk us by the hand, if we are simple enough to accept the offer. It is this light in our paths, horizons and hearts that the coward robs himself of. In a great Soul the ideal invites the heart to what is possible and instructs the mind on how to see it realized. It is this function of the ideal which will occupy most of our investigation. For if we can be guided by the truest, most rightful ideal, if we can populate our private sky with the truest stars, we can be best guided and walk in their light. A most desirable existence; simple and noble toil under the light is endlessly curative and redemptive. It renders the pain of judgment into a taunt or a playful invitation. It lets us bear the weight of the Cosmos, if we have the courage to.</p>
    <p>4. Secondly, our ideals speak to everything. To the degree that an ideal is embodied, or simply housed, it will color every perception, action and thought of its host, who, in turn and time, will color everything that can accept color. Our ideals, in consort with our values, stand at the gates of our senses, discriminate greatly and let through to us only what has been deemed worthy of our ever insufficient resources. We must need to see to be able to. Most of our life unfolds downstream of this fact; but not all of it. In the expanse of being plenty of room exists to see, or be seen, unintentionally.</p>
    <p>5. Thirdly, our ideals speak of us. We do not, entirely choose our ideals. After all, we do not entirely choose the values of which our ideals are symbolical conclusions of. The simplest example of this, and the one most pertinent to our investigation is that of our biology. Our biology requires a given nutrition, we thus value food and, proportional to our hunger, our senses grow sensitive to it. One does not choose this value and, while I’ve seen it being overpowered by the will or the situation, I’ve yet to see it discarded. We also have cultural values. Much more pliable than our biological values but never the less not chosen; in the case of many. Ideas of justice, respect and purpose, among many others are usually inherited unintentionally from our culture, be it society at large, a city, a town, a family or an individual. Cultural values and biological values are fundamentally the same when looked at a little distance. Our culture has never existed without our biology. Less intuitively, our biology has never existed without culture. All men, no matter how primeval, were born into some form of society and culture. Culture, like fire and civilization, have profoundly molded our biology. These two ideas of biology and culture cannot be carelessly separated. This is especially true the more ancient one of this composite values is.</p>
    <p>6. Aside from the more worldly or material values, though, we have our will, and soul, and consciousness. I hold these truths to be self-evident. And so does biology and culture. That we are one with everything and yet free selves is one of these ancient values that must not be handled lightly, even though it seems to be a complete contradiction. You are everything, and thus you have inherited all sorts of fateful inertias and trajectories. But you are also Man and, like Emerson puts it, you have your own stern claims and perfect circle, and your claims are not to be put by, if you will stand by yourself.</p>
    <p>7. Fourthly, our ideals speak of Everything.</p>
    <p>8. It is my hope that the absolute necessity of the Truest and most Rightful ideals has now been impressed on you. It may seem daunting, at a glance, to hope to undertake a task such as sculpting the perfect ideal for oneself. After all, the sheer scale of the Cosmos and everything unknown in it, the scale of Chaos, is sure to be unfathomably larger than us. If one’s drowsy character lets the mind drift there, there seems to be so much of everything and so little of us. Anything we do not know is a potential flaw and a threat to us and any ideal we can hope to put together. We have all believed something, trusted it to guide us and have later found it to be erroneous or even wicked. Our ideals seem vulnerable to Chaos. But they are not; if they are the right ideals. The scale of Chaos is not larger than Man. Man, you, makes his own scale of things. All of the hidden threats of Chaos cannot hope to reach the nobility in you, if you don’t let it. You are the Logos made flesh. Your soul is of a finer making.</p>
    <p>9. Moreover, our ideals are also sensitive to Order. Biology and Culture, as mentioned before, have instructed us greatly since the very beginning. They furnish us with broad and provisional values and ideals. It is easy to groan and moan about the poor fit and wear and tear of such inherited ideals but one must still be grateful that he is not left alone and naked in the boundless Chaos. They provide a starting point for the work of a life; for the careful hand-making of your Self. The work of discovering what ideals and values inhabit you and sincerely taking and adding to them as you see it Right. It needs not, is expected not to be perfect the first time around. I’ve learned to be truly grateful for this external sort of Order. The common values are a pathetic thing, but we need not concern ourselves with them, they are shallow and fleeting. But the common is not all that is inherited. The most harmonious truths and lucid insights of all ages are also very much part of our private estate, and it is with them that we will concern ourselves greatly.</p>
    <p>10. There are ancient, organic and universal values and resulting patterns of behavior, Archetypes as they are usually called. Ancient, because the have existed since before humanity and even culture itself in the form of biology; instinct and subconscious. Organic because of their natural emergence from the fact of being. And universal, because of their omnipresence in culture. Human and pre-human alike. Not all archetypes are guiding ideals for the private man, but the ones we will concern ourselves with are. Three ideals seemed to me pertinent to our investigation. The Hero, The King and The Father of Nations. They are sequential. The becoming a Hero being a prerequisite to becoming a King and after, a Father of Nations. This natural sequence provides us with an evident road to the being and becoming of our Soul as man. A road of self-evident meaning. A road that can only be traveled by virtue and nobility. A Via Regia of the Soul.</p>
    <p>11. The following three sections will explore each of these ideals individually. While this introduction has been quite systematic and organized, the following pages will be exploratory and impressionistic. Entire books can and have been written about these ideals by themselves but I do not mean to describe or explore them exhaustively, if that was even possible. My interest is in the way these ideals relate to each other and in turn to the Soul of Man.</p>
