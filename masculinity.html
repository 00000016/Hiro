    <h1><a id="being">On Being a Man</a></h1>
    <p class="exception">“And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny; and not minors and invalids in a protected corner, not cowards fleeing before a revolution, but guides, redeemers and benefactors, obeying the Almighty effort and advancing on Chaos and the Dark”<br><br>- Ralph Waldo Emerson, Self-Reliance, paragraph 3</p>
    <p>1. In just about any culture, in just about any age, with the exception of the current one, a boy in his mid to late teens would undergo some sort of rite of passage or initiation, going in a boy and coming out a Man. He would be expected to carry himself like a man in his relationships with the world. In turn, he could expect from the world the due respect and privileges that are obvious part of his position in it. As long as this position too, is obvious.</p>
    <p>2. My question for you, reader, is, did you have a culturally, socially, emotionally and spiritually profound initiation into manhood? By your own appraisal, do you feel like you are a Man? Do you think that you live up to the title? I know that, for me, the answer to those questions is a clear “No.” And I trust my experience when it tells me that the same is true for almost all would-be men. If they are honest with themselves. But why?</p>
    <p>3. When it comes to initiations, Nature initiates women and Culture initiates men. Femininity has always been of Nature and masculinity has always been of Culture. “Women are, Men become”, as the saying goes. There are, obviously, natural, biological aspects to masculinity as well as cultural aspects to femininity but when we inquire, what is it that makes us? Ultimately, the previous truth stands. Male biology is a prerequisite, is permissive, to masculinity, but it is not masculinity itself. This explains squarely the crisis of masculinity that has colored the last four or five decades. Nature’s constancy has still given structure to femininity, even in the absence of a culture that does so. The same cannot be said for masculinity. Culture has failed men. And, to the degree that culture is the province of Man, Men have failed Men. We inherited a culture made by weak men.</p>
    <p>4. I know that I am falling short and not living up to the demands of masculinity. Nature, very clearly, tells me that much. My Soul feels as if it was rotting. But I don’t know what it is that I am falling short of, nor how to fix it. And this, Nature will not tell me; most feminine indeed. I don’t know what it means to be a Man, so how could I not fail? Why wasn’t I taught by Culture what it means to be a Man? Why do I feel like something was stolen from me?</p>
    <p>5. This and the following essays are an attempt, for my own sake, to understand and describe masculinity. To answer the question “What does it mean to be a Man?” This question glimmers with the prospect of adventure; of unthinkable potential; of reclaiming a birthright; of cherishing a long neglected heritage, answering it’s claims, making it proud and, in time, take my rightful place in it.</p>
