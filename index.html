    <!--<h2>&#x1f534 On Being a Man <a href="masculinity.html">Read</a> (In Progress)</h2>
    <h3>My exploratory essay on masculinity. Desperately being written for my own sake. I realized that the real reason I wasn't a proper man was because
    I had no idea of what it meant to be a man to begin with. This essay is an effort to correct that and articulate what it means to be a man.</h3>-->
