    <h2>&#x1f534 On Being a Man          <a href="masculinity.html">Read</a></h2>
    <h3>My exploratory essay on masculinity. Desperately being written for my own sake. I realized that the real reason I wasn't a proper man was because
    I had no idea of what it meant to be a man to begin with. This essay is an effort to correct that and articulate what it means to be a man.</h3>
    
    <h2>&#127795 Understanding "Self-Reliance"          <a href="self-reliance.html">Read</a></h2>
    <h3>My explanatory essay on Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Self-Reliance" essay. As I saw it, despite being Emerson's most famous work, the "Self-Reliance" essay was
    almost completely misunderstood both by the common reader and the academic. This essay was an effort to correct that and explain the soul of "Self-Reliance"</h3>
