    <h3>For most of my adult life I’ve lived on part-time jobs. The decision was essentially made for me by my character. Not even in a nightmare could I have imagined working a full time job, or attending “higher” education. It always seemed to me like I would have to lose my Self-respect and my highest aspirations to fit into modern normalcy. Those are things to which injury is unacceptable; so I’ve always insisted on Self-sovereignty, even as a kid, even on instinct.</h3>
    <h3>I don’t mean this essay to be boastful or evangelizing but to record my thoughts faithfully. If it does read as boastful it does so unintentionally; but faithfully. I never escaped the rat race because I never joined it to begin with. This essay, however, may prove useful to any reader who might currently be entertaining sincere questions regarding freedom, sovereignty, and human dignity and potential.</h3>
    <h3>To the point, the purpose of living on a part-time job, or similar things like seasonal work, is to have it be a first step towards Self-reliance and independence; to take more of your life in your own hands. With the ultimate goal, of course, of complete personal sovereignty. The exchange seems evident, a lower income, less stability, and a lower social status for time and potential. But there is much more to this type of living, so in the following paragraphs I will address in proper detail the actual praxis of living on a part-time job.</h3>
    <h3>On money; the obvious concern is well founded. You will earn less money per hour worked part-time, and you will also work considerably less hours too, all in all earning significantly less; from your job, that is. I will readily admit to have struggled to make my finances work, and even when they do work they do so very tightly. I’ve had to sacrifice everything that wasn’t absolutely necessary and narrow the definition of “absolutely necessary” a fair bit too.</h3>
    <h3>Yet, I wouldn’t have it any other way. What I’ve gained in exchange dwarf any sacrifice by comparison. The obvious gain is that of time. My time is worth more that any wage that I could command in other people’s appraisal, so I keep as much of it as I can to myself. An hour of study is worth much more than an hour’s worth of even good wages. So, is an hour spent with one’s loved ones, or taking care of oneself by exercising or sleeping a proper amount. These types of activities are not only invaluable to the human Soul but also very practical in their value too. Health spares money and makes one productive, and strong, loving circle of family and friends is the foundation of long term wealth and private stability; in case that being some of life’s biggest sources of meaning and fulfillment was not enough. For those still concerned about money and with the material value of their time I would like to add that time spent on a personal project or business will almost definitely be more profitable than selling that time out.</h3>
    <h3>Incidentally, and poetically, this type of living is very tax efficient. Learning, training, spending time with your loved ones, making whatever you need instead of buying it are all non taxable activities, despite their immense value. While your income might be lower, so will your tax burden. Learning to make and fix one’s own things too is very tax efficient. One doesn’t need to earn and thus be taxed on the money for the purchase nor does he need to be taxed on the transaction itself.</h3>
    <h3>The sacrifices that I made in making ends meet on a very narrow income were their own reward too. Frugality and minimalism where actually very sweet medicines. All the expenses that I had to give up where, in retrospect, vices. Ready-made processed foods, alcohol, gadgets and trinkets that quickly became garbage and clutter, “entertainment” not as art or for it’s own sake but to passively numb and distract myself, outings, activities and relationships that contributed nothing to my life, among others. Important expenses, a gift, or a dinner with a loved one, or a trip with a dear friend, I did not sacrifice; I didn’t need to, and I wouldn’t have anyways. Frugality is simply wisdom applied to one’s finances. It is not a trait of the poor but very much the opposite, it is the foundation of wealth.</h3>
    <h3>Minimalism is the ridding yourself of everything that is not truly you, and yours. The psychological and practical benefits of it are immense. To decide on what to let go of and what to keep one needs to think of his values, of where he is going, or wants to go, in the future, of where he was in the past, when he browses through his possessions, of what would be good and what would be bad for him. Possessions that don’t serve us gather dust, get in the way, and require maintenance and storage, both physically and psychologically, and should be gotten rid of as soon as possible, or even better, and more to the point of money, should not be acquired to begin with.</h3>
    <h3>On stability and benefits; just like with money, I will readily admit to the usual worries. In living like this one will have a lot less external stability. Having, usually, no benefits nor insurances provided by one’s job, a less stable and predictable an income, and much less of one’s day and life planned in advance for him. Now, while the money issue was a real sacrifice, the loss of external stability is a good thing, like removing the training wheels off of a bike; to begin with they don’t actually serve as training for riding a bike, but instead artificially allow someone to ride one when they would have been otherwise incapable of by themselves.</h3>
    <h3>If you want stability, make some yourself. The solution for a loss of externally imposed stability is to internally impose it oneself. This is not a chore but a prerogative and a responsibility of anyone who would live sincerely. I live like this because I aspire to a life of self-sovereignty; to have as much of my life in my own hands as possible. If we take life in our hands, and our life is worse for it, what does that say about our hands? Nothing makes a man grow like responsibility. Be your own law to yourself. If you want routine, take rightful control of every hour, and minute, and instant, your birthright, and assign it a task that is true to your Self.</h3>
    <h3>Beyond sovereignty, this type of life provides you with immense freedom and agility. You can change your situation freely and impressionisticly. If work is easily acquired and gotten rid of, as part time work is, you need not stay in a bad work environment, or even a boring one, or even worse, one you have outgrown. Simply having freedom and options keeps you, in large part, from getting into a bad situation to begin with.</h3>
    <h3>Living like this I’ve naturally held three or four different occupations in any given year; sometimes in parallel. I go out of my way to diversify them too, after higher priorities, like convenience, have been met. In so doing, I’ve gotten, in any given year, many times over the experiences and learnings of normal people around me. That is actual experiences and not “years of experience.” The type that comes from being engaged with life and not with a corrupt abstraction of it. Earned for one’s own sake and not for show and display of how obedient one is; for how many years he’s been a good boy.</h3>
    <h3>I have earned my living by all sorts of occupations, from manual labor, like landscaping and construction to more sedentary ones, like teaching, painting and programming; as for programming I’ve since cut my use of computers to less than an hour a day and no longer consider it an option. I’ve greatly enjoyed my time working at restaurants or in bakeries; I like food and I find the work particularly human and relaxing, the more so the smaller the business.</h3>
    <h3>Another benefit of living like this is that one can start immediately, sometimes as early as sixteen years old. If one truly does not feel a calling to a craft or study that would absolutely require higher education, as few of them do, then he can spare himself four to eight years of Self-deception and infantilism, along with a hefty sum of money, and start living at once.</h3>
    <h3>In working such a wide variety of jobs, and in the process of acquiring, and leaving them too, I’ve gained some of my most valuable skills so far. Naturally, I’ve learned a large amount of simple skills, like making and handling concrete, taking accurate measures, cutting steel, baking bread, cleaning grease off of things, preparing a wide range of dishes, using all sorts of tools and on, and on. But more importantly, and not so naturally, I’ve learned a handful of abstract skills that I’ve found to be invaluable time and again. Learning to negotiate, how so many businesses work from the inside, charisma, from the bar owner whose entire business relies on it, among others, will be of great use to anyone in any affair involving people, even if he doesn’t plan on going into business. And I say that these came less naturally because while these still can be learned, they can’t be taught, and as such one must extract them out from the experience oneself.</h3>
    <h3>In all, working such a wide variety of occupations has made for a much richer, and much more human, life. A life where exploration and playfulness are still very much alive and a priority far above any job, which is now a temporary detail. For, despite this essay dwelling so long on the idea of jobs, it’s aim is to trivialize the idea, and if possible, describe a way of living in which life is still an adventure.</h3>
    <h3>On career paths; closely related to the previous paragraphs is the concern of one’s progress in life. Indeed, living like this you will not be on a set, long term, career path, let alone a corporate ladder or accumulating “years of experience.” Now, much of what was written before has already, essentially, covered this topic too; your life is in your hands; concern yourself with reality and not abstractions of it. Beyond this, there are only a few things to say regarding progress and the future.</h3>
    <h3>Knowledge is for you; accreditation is for other people. The term “The System” carries with it all sorts of connotations that make it difficult to use, despite this the term is still alive and very much in use, the reason for this is simple, there is truth to it; it is useful. We need to ask ourselves whether we are investing in ourselves or in the system. Knowledge, not titles; a life, not a career; resources, not money; loved ones, not “connections.” “All money needs to be weaponized to reduce once dependence on money” as Luke Smith puts it. Invest everything in yourself from the beginning.</h3>
    <h3>As a fourth and final concern that most people have when presented with the idea of living like this is that of social status, and the opinion of others. To this concern, just like all the previous ones, I’ll readily admit to; you will be thought of as having a lower social status by other people, particularly people who don’t know you. But this concern too, like the previous ones, dissolves readily, if we live properly.</h3>
    <h3>Other people’s opinion of us means very little. The type of person that would look down on you is someone who you should look down upon back. “But I hate the people that hate me”, Nietzsche, roughly paraphrased. The disapproval of people who live pathetic lives should be understood as a compliment. Other people’s opinion will only ever matter if we seek permission or approval from them. But why? If foreign opinion affects our life we are living like slaves and beggars. “Ask not ‘who will let me?’, but ‘who will stop me?’”, Aynie.</h3>
    <h3>“B-but women!”, worry some of you; I’ve never had problems with women.</h3>
    <h3>The life that I’m proposing is obviously not one of just saying “no” to normal employment, but one of saying “yes” to real life. If we spend our newfound time wisely and progressively take every new instant as ours then, in time, we will have plenty to show for it. Things learned, and built, and lived. The early sacrifices of money, predictability and social status, you will find, quickly become trivial, if not medals. In time, they are more than made up for too; sincere living must necessarily be more productive than a life of Self-deception. Part time employment will soon too, become unnecessary. Taking that much more of our life in our hands is a daunting task, but we will grow to match it.</h3>
