    <h2>&#x1f4d7 Ralph Waldo Emerson: All Essays <a href="https://www.amzn.com/B0BM81V695">Get a Copy</a></h2>
    <h3>Emerson is one of the greatest writers of all time and his work has been a big influence on me. Because, upon searching for one, I couldn't find a comprehensive
    collection of all of Emerson's essays I took the liberty to compile all of them in one book for my own studies. 
    Naturally I also put it up for sale as both a phisical copy and a kindle. You can support me by buying a copy. I strongly recommend anyone to read Emerson's work,
    for which you <i>do not</i> need to buy the book, all of Emerson's work is in the public domain and can be readily found online.</h3>
